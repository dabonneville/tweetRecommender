        <h3>About TweetRecommender</h3>
        <p>
          TweetRecommender tries to solve a seemingly simple question:  Which
          tweets are relevant for a given news article?
        </p>
        <p>
          The use cases are two-fold.  First, the authoring journalist of an
          article could be interested in feedback for his article.  Did he
          mention everything, did he omit anything critical?  How is his style,
          are there any errors?  The same question holds true for a critical
          reader:  Is the article she just read a good one, what do others
          think?  What is the relevant background?
        </p>
        <p>
          The system works on a collection of tweets and articles which it has
          pre-processed (for performance and modeling reasons.)  When a user
          enters an article into the query interface, there are three different
          steps to get a ranked list of relevant tweets:  First, a set of
          potentially relevant tweets is <emph>gathered</emph>.  This works by
          searching for the article&rsquo;s URL or contents in the collection
          of tweets.  Second, this set is trimmed down again (by, e.&nbsp;g.,
          restricting the search to a date ranging around the article&rsquo;s
          time of publication.)  Third, the set of tweets is ranked according
          to one or more scoring functions.  These are combined in a classical
          voting ballot fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Web application is only one interface to the database and query
          algorithms.  These are readily exposed as a programming library in
          Python and a command-line interface.  Find the

        <p>
          This project was built by the four <a href="http://hpi.de/">HPI</a>
          students Christian Godde, Robert Lehmann, Timur Pratama Wiradarma,
          and Thomas Werkmeister.  From April to August 2014, they have been
          working on
